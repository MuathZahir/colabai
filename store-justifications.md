# Chrome Web Store Extension Justifications

## Single Purpose Description
ColabAI is designed with a single, focused purpose: to enhance the Google Colab notebook experience by providing AI-powered assistance for code generation and notebook management. The extension integrates directly with Google Colab's interface to help users write, modify, and organize their notebook content more efficiently. All features - including cell management and code generation - serve this unified purpose of making Colab notebooks more productive and easier to work with.

## Permission Justifications

### Storage Permission
**Justification:** The storage permission is essential for:
1. Saving user preferences and settings for consistent experience across sessions
2. Caching authentication tokens securely
3. Maintaining conversation history with the AI assistant for context-aware responses
4. Storing user configuration for AI interaction preferences

### Identity Permission
**Justification:** The identity permission is required for:
1. Authenticating users securely using Google OAuth
2. Ensuring secure access to paid features and subscription management
3. Personalizing the AI assistant experience based on user preferences
4. Maintaining user session state across browser restarts

### Host Permission (Content Scripts)
**Justification for `"https://colab.research.google.com/*"`:**
1. The extension specifically enhances Google Colab notebooks, requiring access to only Colab URLs
2. Content script injection is necessary to:
   - Integrate AI assistance directly into the Colab interface
   - Add custom UI elements for interaction with the AI
   - Monitor and respond to notebook changes
   - Manage notebook cells programmatically
3. The permission is strictly limited to Colab's domain, ensuring no access to other websites
4. All features (AI assistance, cell management, code generation) require direct integration with Colab's interface

## Implementation Details
- All permissions are used minimally and only when required
- Data access is limited to the specific Colab notebook being worked on
- No broad host permissions are requested
- All operations are transparent to the user
- Security best practices are followed for data handling and authentication
